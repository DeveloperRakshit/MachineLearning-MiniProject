# MachineLearning-MiniProject
Performing Principal Component Analysis on Wine Dataset

This is the final year mini project for COMPUTER SCIENCE students of the subject Machine Learning.
It is a very easy to understand project but very important.
I have performed PCA on the wine dataset I got from Kaggle.
I have done all the preprocessing on the dataset and now the data is completely clean.
In order to run the project simply run PCA_Wine.py.

I'm also attaching a PDF file showing a step by step output of the project code..

Pre-requisites:
numpy 
pandas and 
matplotlib

You can install them by typing on Anaconda Command prompt as:

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
